        Currently, there are some 1.6 million Americans living with T1D, and there is no known cure
      </h5>
      <p>
        T1 is an autoimmune disease that causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin, and the body cannot manage blood-sugar levels on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only way to manage T1 is with insulin, and constantly monitoring blood-sugar levels. Instead of multiple finger pricks a day to check blood sugar levels, a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) can be worn. One common brand of CGM is the Dexcom. It sends data with your blood sugar readings, every five minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This data is instrumental to managing your day to day activites with T1 diabetes. It can be overwhelming, however, to suddenly be confronted with a rollercoaster of blood-sugar highs and lows. CarbCounter allows you to look up the carb count in the foods you eat. Once you've entered a meal, CarbCounter will help you visualize what you've eaten compared to your blood sugar. Over time, you'll gain insight about how various foods work for you - not just the carb number.
